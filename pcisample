There are two configuration methods, depending on the PCI chipsets used:

Configuration Type 1:

CF8h D(R/W):
bit   0-7  Index into the configuration space to read/write at CFCh
    11-15  Card ID (0 - 31)
    16-19  PCI Bus ID (0 - 15)
       31  Set to enable the PCI bus configuration space

CFCh D(R/W):
bit  0-31  The index register identified by the PCI bus/card ID/Index in CF8h
           can be accessed here.


Configuration Type 2:

CF8h (R/W):
bit   7  Set to select the PCI configuration space

CFAh (R/W):
bit 0-?  Bus select ?


Finding the PCI devices:

  PCItype:=0;
  outp($CF8,0);
  outp($CFA,0);
  if (inp($CF8)=0) and (inp($CFA)=0) then PCItype:=2
  else begin
    tmp=inpl($CF8);
    outpl($CF8,$80000000);
    if inpl($CF8)=$80000000 then PCItype:=1;
    outpl($CF8,tmp);
  end;
  case PCItype of
    1:begin   {PCI type 1}
        for i:=0 to 511 do
        begin
          outpl($CF8,$80000000+i*longint(2048));
          tmp:=inpl($CFC);
          if ((tmp and $FFFF)<>$FFFF) and ((tmp shr 16)<>$FFFF) then
            _PCI Device: Vendor: (l and $FFFF)  Device: (l shr 16)_
        end;
      end;
    2:begin   {PCI type 2}
        outp($CF8,$80);
        outp($CFA,0);   {Bus select?}
        for i:=0 to 15 do
        begin
          tmp:=inpl(i*256 +$C000);
          if ((tmp and $FFFF)<>$FFFF) and ((tmp shr 16)<>$FFFF) then
            _PCI Device: Vendor: (l and $FFFF)  Device: (l shr 16)_
        end;
        outp($CF8,0);
      end;
  end;


The PCI BIOS interface requires a 386 or better CPU.

The PCI configuration space consists of 256bytes per device, the first 64
bytes are laid out as follows, though an adapter may not implement all fields.

Offset  Size    Description:
  00h   WORD    Vendor ID. FFFFh is reserved.
  02h   WORD    Device ID. FFFFh is reserved.
  04h   WORD    System Bus Command
                Bit 0  I/O Space. If set the device is allowed to respond to
                       I/O requests, if clear the device does not respond.
                    1  Memory Space. If set the device is allowed to respond
                       to Meory requests, if clear the device does not
                       respond.
                    3  Special Cycles. If set the device is allowed to monitor
                       special cycles.
                    5  VGA Palette Snoop. If set special snooping behavior is
                       enabled. The device must not respond to DAC writes.
                       If clear palette accesses are treated normally.
                    6  Parity Error. If set the device responds to parity
                       errors, if clear it ignores them. The device must
                       generate parity even if this bit is clear.
                    7  Wait Cycle Control. If set data/address stepping is
                       enabled, disabled if clear.
                    8  System Error Driver. If set the error driver reports
                       parity errors, if clear the system error driver is
                       disconnected.
                    9  Back-to-Back Cycle. If set the device supports back-to
                        -back cycles.
  06h   WORD    System Bus Status
                Bit 7  (R) Fast back-to-back. If set the device is capable of

                       issues a Target Abort. Write 1 to reset.
                   12  Received Target-abort. Set whenever the device (as
                       Master) receives a Target Abort. Write 1 to reset.
                   13  Master Abort Status. Set whenever the device issues a
                       Master Abort. Write 1 to reset.

                            clear if it is in Memory space.
                   1-2  (R) Locatable Area. 0: Anywhere in 32bit address space
                             1: Below 1MB, 2: anywhere in 64bit address space
                     3  (R) Pre-fetchable. Set if memory is cacheable, clear
