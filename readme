redo all the interrupt task.Took help from the http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/index.html and http://www.osdever.net/bkerndev/Docs/idt.htm.
Nearly all the basic feature of interrupt are now done.Next time I will be doing PIT and keyboard isr. bye...

date 6/10/11
I competed the keyboard driver and pit today.
i just wrote the handler for both these and rest was already there.
right now I have written a common handler for isr and normal software interrupts, divide by zero, etc.
Next time I will do virtual memory implementation.
