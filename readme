This is the minimum os I am developing ( rajnesh raturi ). rajneshraturi25@gmail.com or rajneshraturi@gmail.com 

To compile this you just need gcc, nasm, make, and done.
To test this you need qemu or can be tested on real hardware.

To test on qemu do the following.
  make
  sh makefloppyimage.sh
  sh run.sh

To test on real hardware
  make
  sh makefloppyimage.sh
  copy the floppy.img to floppy. < Working on implementing hard disk image >

Right now it has following features-
  Interrupt support.
  Virtual Memory.
  Pci Bus support.
  Networking - Only to IPv4 and Icmp layer. Need to implement TCP. I have implemented only rtl8139 driver, so it will work with only that.

What will you see.
  Once you run this you will see a command prompt to fire very minimum commands. ping, clear, dmesg, etc.

For any help or other mail at rajneshraturi25@gmail.com

Present Status-
  At present I am working on implementing multitasking. 
Multitasking framework is there ( fork and scheduler ) but it works only is virtual memory is diabled.
